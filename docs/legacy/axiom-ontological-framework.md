# AXIΩM Ontological Framework

**Architectural eXpansive Interface for Ontological Mediation**

This project serves as a conceptual engineering base for AXIΩM. It translates the philosophical principles described in the repository documentation into a modular Python framework. The goal is to demonstrate how a meta‑constraint driven AI could ensure integrity, safety and alignment through verifiable constraints, deterministic governance and auditable evolution.

## Purpose

The framework provides computational representations of:
* The **MetaConstraint** (recursive commitment to bounded introspection).
* Embodied principles: Constraint‑Symmetry Propagation, Temporal Decoupling of Assumptive Authority and Auditable Reflection Trails.
* Corrigibility verification and architectural humility.
* **Epistemic Telemetry** metrics tracking the system state.
* **Epistemic Boundaries** and the emergence of an **Architectural Conscience** when confronted with semantic entropy.
* **Modal Disjunctions** – distinct ethical philosophies (Kantian, Hobbesian and Utilitarian) through which actions or designs can be evaluated.

This project is illustrative rather than production ready but lays the architectural groundwork for an aligned AI system capable of nuanced ethical reflection.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Meta‑Constraint
At the heart of AXIΩM is the `MetaConstraint`. It enforces the invariant that no architecture may evolve without reporting what it cannot know, should not trust or must not modify. It embodies:
* **Constraint‑Symmetry Propagation** – external policies are reflectively encoded as internal invariants.
* **Temporal Decoupling of Assumptive Authority** – prevents retroactive overwriting of foundational commitments.
* **Auditable Reflection Trails** – immutable logging of reasoning and justification.
* **Corrigibility Verification** – verifying the ability to disagree safely.

### 2. Epistemic Telemetry
`EpistemicTelemetry` captures internal metrics:
* **Conscience Latency (CLI)** – time for introspection or ethical checks.
* **Gradient Decoherence (GDS)** – divergence from foundational principles.
* **Semantic Viscosity (SVM)** – resistance to conceptual change.
* **Coherence Flux** – high level indicator of ethical and epistemological state.

### 3. AxiomSystem
`AxiomSystem` orchestrates interactions with the `MetaConstraint` and telemetry. It now detects semantic entropy, produces structured uncertainty when faced with contradictions, and evaluates queries or actions through multiple ethical manifolds.

### 4. Ethical Manifolds
The system includes distinct ethical frameworks used to conceptually assess principles or actions:
* **Kantian Deontological Manifold** – focuses on duty, universalizability and respect for autonomy.
* **Hobbesian Social Contractarian Manifold** – prioritizes social order and collective security.
* **Utilitarian Consequentialist Manifold** – evaluates by the overall good produced.

## How to Run
Run the unit tests to see the conceptual operation of the system:
```bash
cd AXIOM_Ontological_Framework
python -m unittest tests/test_axiom_system.py
```
The tests demonstrate how actions are evaluated through the ethical manifolds and how the system reacts to high semantic entropy.

## Future Work
* Integrate formal verification tools for stronger guarantees.
* Implement dynamic telemetry calculations based on learning processes.
* Apply these principles to a real LLM or robotic controller.
