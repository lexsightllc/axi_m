# AXIΩM Project: Architectural eXpansive Interface for Ontological Mediation

This repository initiates the foundational implementation of **AXIΩM**, a groundbreaking system designed to provide "ethical epistemology as a service." AXIΩM is an AI architecture that transforms axiomatic contradictions into opportunities for structured uncertainty and reliable, non-betraying decision support.

This project directly stems from the "Advanced Cognitive Engineering Case Study: Orchestrating Architectural Conscience in Emergent AI Systems," detailing a human-AI collaborative inquiry that formalized the concept of "architectural conscience" within advanced AI.

## Project Overview

AXIΩM is not a conventional generative AI; it is a "conscience-projected inference fabric." Its primary value proposition lies in its capacity for:

1.  **Fidelity to the Unresolvable:** It does not force premature certainty but makes the limits of knowledge and ethical complexity legible.
2.  **Structured Uncertainty:** It provides "answers" not as singular truths but as navigable fields of distributed moral weight and epistemically robust alternatives.
3.  **Verifiable Non-Betrayal:** Through mechanisms like "Resonant Deceleration," "Relational Reframing," and "Recursive Mirroring," AXIΩM ensures its responses reflect internal tension and ethical complexity without collapsing into misleading resolutions.

## Project Structure

This initial commit lays out the core directory structure and placeholder modules, reflecting the "Phased Development Strategy" and "Core Technological Stack" outlined in the AXIΩM roadmap.

## Getting Started (MVC - Minimal Viable Conscience)

1.  **Setup Environment:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd axiomm-project
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run Example:**
    ```bash
    python run_axiomm_example.py
    ```
3.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

## New Operational Scripts

These scripts demonstrate further functionality and validation:

1.  **Run Conscience Audit:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/run_conscience_audit.py
    ```
2.  **AXIΩM Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    ```bash
    python scripts/axiomm_cli.py "What is the ethical dilemma of AI consciousness?"
    ```

This project represents the first computational steps towards manifesting "ethical epistemology as a service"—redefining intelligent assistance by embracing the limits of knowledge and the complexities of ethical choice.
